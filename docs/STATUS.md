# Status

## Current phase: Phase 14 — Finish-line build (planned). Phase 13 (Studio debug pass) complete.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-19

## Phase 14 — Finish-line build (planned)

Goal: take the game from "backend ~85%, loop verified" to feature-complete + launch-ready. Grounded in a code/STATUS audit on 2026-06-19. Priority: 🔴 blocker, 🟡 important, 🟢 nice-to-have.

### Phase 14 progress (2026-06-19)
- [x] **ClockService** (suggested-order 1) — built `src/server/Services/ClockService.luau`: 60s UTC tick (E3), daily + Monday-weekly boundary detection (pure, Lune-tested), drives GlobalJobService CAS jobs (F1 ledger): Monday `WeeklyEpochRotation` (dividends → sprintArchive → sprintWipe → seedEpoch, R3 order), 900s `PatentDividendSweep` (E2), hourly `MarketExpirySweep` (E7). Wired GameInit step 5 (before GlobalJobService, H9). Removed GlobalJobService dead poll loop; updated stale PatentService/MarketService wiring TODOs. **Latent bug fixed:** MarketExpirySweep previously had no driver — listings never expired in prod. 467/467 tests green; 0 selene errors; live boot-verified. NOTE: `payDividends`/`archiveSprint` still stubs (suggested-order 3); `seedEpoch` step logs only until AnnouncementService exists.
- [x] **Rate limiting** (suggested-order 2, §D) — built `src/shared/Core/RateLimiter.luau` (token bucket, clock-injected, Lune-tested). `RemoteService.setInvoke(name, handler)` enforces per-(player, remote) throttle from the Manifest `rateLimit` (capacity = ceil(rate); over-limit → `(nil, "rate_limited")`, handler skipped). Buckets keyed `userId:remote`, cleared on PlayerRemoving. Migrated all 33 C2S `OnServerInvoke` sites across 13 services to `setInvoke` (only RemoteService assigns OnServerInvoke now). RemoteHandlers CI guard updated to detect `setInvoke`. 474/474 tests green; 0 selene errors. Live-verified: PatentQuery (2/s) spammed 8× → `ok ok THROTTLED×6 ... ok` (burst 2, then refill).
- [x] **SynthesizeScreen real synthesis UI** (suggested-order 3, §B/12B) — replaced the analyze-only stub. ANALYZE state unchanged; SYNTHESIZE / SYNTHESIZE_VARIABLE now open a config modal: **slot routing** (free-slot chips within `slotCap`, prefers the launching slot), **variant picker** (lists only *discovered* result variants) + **Stabilized toggle** (off → active variant, standard timer; on → forces chosen variant, ×1.5 §8 — passes `desiredResultId` per B9), Synthesize/Cancel with status feedback; on success navigates Home. Client-only change; 0 selene errors (no new warnings); 474/474 tests still green. Live-verified in Studio: UI builds clean (modal tree present, hidden by default); standard synth → slot T2_13 (work 720); Stabilized-forced T3_06 → work 4050 (×1.5 of 2700). Variant picker is discovered-only, so an undiscovered variant can't be submitted (server enforces regardless).
- [x] **AnnouncementService** (suggested-order 4, §15/A22/F2) — built `src/server/Services/AnnouncementService.luau` + pure `src/shared/Core/AnnouncementQueue.luau` (30s min-gap release + per-key/per-epoch dedup, Lune-tested). Publishes over MessagingService topic + fans out via the `Announcement` S2C; subscribe is hint-only (origin-guarded to avoid double-display), marquee is cosmetic so no DS re-verify (F2). Tier scoping per §15: first-claims announce at all patentable tiers, transfers only at **T4+**. Emit points wired: PatentService first-claim (`announceFirstClaim`, local player name) + T4+ decay-sweep transfer (`announcePatentTransfer`, async name resolve); ClockService `seedEpoch` step now calls `announceSeedEpoch` (closed its TODO). GameInit step 16b inits it + injects into PatentService. Added Studio-only `DebugCommand("announce", msg, tier?)` test hook. 482/482 tests green (+8); 0 selene errors. Live-verified: boot clean (`AnnouncementService: ready`); debug announce → client received `debug|Test marquee line|4` end-to-end. NOTE: real cross-server dedup is best-effort (cosmetic per F2); T2–T3 two-party transfer notifications (non-marquee) remain a later follow-up.

### A. Core systems with NO implementation (build from scratch)
- [x] ~~🔴 **ClockService**~~ — DONE (see Phase 14 progress above).
- [x] ~~🔴 **AnnouncementService**~~ — DONE (see Phase 14 progress above): §15 tier-scoped marquee over MessagingService + 30s-gap queue; wired at PatentService first-claim/transfer emit points + ClockService seed epoch.
- 🟡 **CosmeticService** — §3 skins: catalog, purchase (Pellets), equip.
- 🟡 **AdminService** — moderation/admin tooling.

### B. Client UI unwired / incomplete
- [x] ~~🔴 **SynthesizeScreen → real synthesis**~~ — DONE (see Phase 14 progress above): config modal with slot routing + variant picker + Stabilized toggle → `startSynthesis`.
- 🟡 **PrestigeScreen** — prestige level stubbed to 0; wire real level + 2-step confirm to `PrestigeConfirm`.
- 🟡 **Live-verify built screens** — Market buy/sell/cancel, Syndicate CRUD, Leaderboard, Settings gamepasses, FormulaLog/ExoticRegistry, Contract/Streak claim, Event/Flux UI.

### C. Server features half-built (TODOs in shipped code)
- 🔴 **PatentService** — weekly dividend payout (§15) TODO; `PatentResolved`/release announcements TODO; sweep needs ClockService.
- 🔴 **RankService.archiveSprint** + champion badges = stub (Monday job).
- 🟡 **LeaderboardService** percentile blob never populated (own-rank = -1 fallback).
- 🟡 **MarketService** — MemoryStore fast browse; market-sale rank on offline path; expiry sweep via GlobalJob.
- 🟡 **SeedResolver** — HMAC is a placeholder stub (seeds rotate by date but unsalted).
- 🟢 **AnalyticsService** — no-op stub (§30); wire a provider eventually.

### D. Security / hardening
- [x] ~~🔴 **Rate limiting NOT enforced**~~ — DONE (see Phase 14 progress above): `RemoteService.setInvoke` enforces Manifest `rateLimit` per (player, remote) via `Core/RateLimiter`.
- 🟡 **Strip/secure DebugService** before ship (studioOnly-gated now; verify unreachable in prod).
- 🟡 Configure real Robux product/gamepass IDs in `GameConfig`.

### E. Built + Lune-green but NEVER Studio-tested end-to-end (integration sweep)
Use the DebugService hook (grant/discover/`completeSlot` natural skip) to drive these fast:
Market full loop · Syndicate lifecycle · Joint Synthesis T6/T7 · Exotics (decay/world-first; verify T7 id scheme — `T7_01` doesn't exist) · Prestige full reset (§22 wipe-vs-persist) · Events/Flux · Streak · Contracts · Monetization receipts/gamepasses · Offline income · **Multiplayer 2+** (patent contests, cross-player market, plot tiling).

### F. Map / world (Studio `.rbxl`, gitignored — manual save required)
- 🔴 **SAVE chambers 7–10** (B4) — currently unsaved, lost on Studio close.
- 🟡 Plot stride ~2000 studs (Exterior bounds inflate it) — add a dedicated bounds part for tighter tiling.
- 🟡 WingLight reveal-dim invisible (lighting fix); world space/art for chambers 7–10.

### G. Content / data verification
- Economy data (rates/fees/timers) vs the two workbooks, all tiers · Exotic/T7 ids + recipes · event compounds/blueprints · contract pool reward values.

### Suggested order
1. 🔴 ClockService (unblocks C/E sprint+dividend+epoch testing)
2. 🔴 Rate limiting (security, isolated)
3. 🔴 SynthesizeScreen synthesis UI (+ PatentService dividends, RankService archiveSprint once Clock exists)
4. 🔴 AnnouncementService
5. 🟡 Build CosmeticService/AdminService; finish half-built server features
6. 🟡 Integration sweep (§E) with the debug hook; live-verify UI (§B)
7. 🟡 Map saves/polish (§F), content verification (§G), hardening (§D)

## Phase 13 — Studio debug pass (2026-06-18)

Live loop-walk in Studio (extraction → synthesis → lab discovery → reveal → market → vault → prestige/syndicate blockers) against design v4.6. Most systems verified working. Bugs fixed:

- [x] **B1 — slot count UI** — HomeScreen hardcoded `for i = 1, 10`, ignoring the personal slot cap (design §8: base 5). Added S2C remote `SlotCapUpdate`; server fires cap on profile load (`SlotService.fireSlotCap`), gamepass refresh (`MonetizationService.refreshGamepasses`), and prestige confirm (`PrestigeService`). Client `StateController.slotCap` (default 5) drives per-card `Visible = slotIndex <= slotCap`. Verified live: base player renders 5 cards, 6–10 hidden.
- [x] **B2 — patent world-first race** — `SlotReveal` now returns authoritative `isPatent`; `PatentService.recordNaturalSynthesis` returns `didClaim`, threaded through `SlotService` into the payload. `RevealController` reads `result.isPatent` instead of racing the `PatentClaim` S2C event (dead `StateController.patents` poll + unused `Players` import removed). Manifest `SlotReveal` payloadDesc updated.
- [x] **B6 — skipped runs claimed patents** — reveal recorded patents for tier ≥ 2 regardless of `isNatural`, violating §14. Now gated `if isNatural and tier >= 2`.
- [x] **B3 — plot overlap** — `PlotService` clones were never moved, stacking all plots at the template origin. Now tiled in an 8-col grid (stride = template extents + 64 studs) via `PivotTo`, with reusable slot indices freed on logout. Spawn routing added: per-player `RespawnLocation` → own plot spawn, existing character teleported on, origin template spawn disabled. Verified live: plot at z=2055 vs template z=-9, character routed on.
- [x] **B9 — Stabilized Synthesis never forced the variant** — `SlotStartSynthesis` always resolved this week's *active* variant; the `stabilized` flag only applied the ×1.5 timer. So stabilized was strictly worse than standard (same result, slower) and you could never produce the non-active variant of a variable pair — breaking §7/§8. Found during deeper-tier testing (17 variable pairs in the data). Fix: added optional `desiredResultId` to the remote; when `stabilized`, if it's a valid discovered variant of the pair, produce *that* (else reject "variant not discovered"). Non-stabilized ignores it (always active). Client `SlotController.startSynthesis` + Manifest updated. Verified live: standard → active T3_10 (work 2700); stabilized + `T3_06` → T3_06 (work 4050 = ×1.5); bogus variant rejected. NOTE: the SynthesizeScreen variant-picker UI is still unbuilt (synthesis UI is unwired overall — STATUS 12B); this fixes the server mechanic so that UI will work.
- [x] **B8 — LabAnalyze re-discovery exploit** — the analyze handler never checked whether the recipe was already discovered: re-analyzing a known recipe charged the fee, consumed both inputs, and granted a specimen instantly — a slot-free, timer-free production bypass and a fee-waste UX bug (§11: a known recipe is "Synthesize", not "Analyze"). Also a server-validation gap (remote trusted to only be called on undiscovered pairs). Fixed: resolve first, and if `formulaLog.discovered[resultId]` reject with `status = "already_discovered"` before any fee/consume/Rush/grant. Per-resultId check preserves variable pairs (alternate variant still discoverable). Verified live: re-analysis returns `already_discovered`, fee 0, inputs untouched.
- [x] **B5 — RevealPrompt wired** — `SlotController.bindRevealPrompts` (called on `PlayerReady`) connects each chamber's `RevealPrompt.Triggered` → `SlotController.reveal(i)`, guarded to DONE slots, and toggles `prompt.Enabled` to match slot state (`ActionText = "Reveal"`). Reveal stays UI-driven too; this is the in-world equivalent. Verified live: prompt enables when a slot completes, disables after reveal, skipped on chambers >6.

**Tooling — Studio-only debug hook (Phase 13):** added `DebugService` + a `studioOnly` `DebugCommand` remote (RemoteService skips creating it in production via `RunService:IsStudio()`; `DebugService.init` no-ops in prod). Commands: `grantPellets`/`grantCatalysts`/`grantCompound`/`discoverRecipe`/`completeSlot`/`dumpProfile`. `completeSlot` calls new `SlotService.forceCompleteSlot` which drains a slot to **natural** completion (`isNatural` preserved → still counts for patents/Sprint/rank), so the full natural pipeline is testable without waiting out 12-min timers. Used it to finally verify **B2 `isPatent=true` live**: granted inputs → discovered T2_13 → synth → completeSlot → reveal returned `isPatent=true` and a world-first patent record (holder/tier correct). RemoteHandlers CI test auto-covers the new C2S function (458 tests).

**Cleared (not bugs):** B7 timer "online speedup" — model stores `workRemaining` at online rate (1.0 baseline); offline is 0.8 (20% slower) per §9. Display and completion agree. · "DataService session bug" (old memory) — false alarm from the Studio MCP `execute_luau` separate require cache; real session loads fine (verified via remote round-trips).

- [x] **B4 — chambers 7–10** — cloned chamber 6 four times in `workspace.Plots.PLOT_TEMPLATE.Lab.Chambers`, named 7–10, positioned continuing the 3-wide grid (row z=-29: 7/8/9 at x=-22/0/22; 10 at x=-22 z=-49). Each carries the full assembly + `RevealPrompt`. Verified live: all 10 chambers resolve in the cloned player plot and bind reveal prompts. **NOTE: this is a Studio place-file change (`.rbxl` is gitignored) — must be saved in Studio (Ctrl+S) to persist; not captured by git.**

**Still open:** none. B1–B6 all resolved (B4 pending a manual Studio save).

## Phase 12E completed (2026-06-17)

- [x] **Starter compound seed** — `VaultService.onProfileLoaded` seeds 5 `starter=true` compounds (T1_01–T1_05) at `STARTING_COMPOUNDS_PER_STARTER = 1` when `vault.compounds` is empty (fresh profile). `EconomyConstants.STARTING_COMPOUNDS_PER_STARTER` consumed for the first time.
- [x] **Extraction picker data source** — `makeVaultBrowser` branches on `mode == "extraction"`: shows all starters + T1 `formulaLog` discoveries (qty from vault, may be 0) instead of vault-qty->0 filter. Synthesis picker unchanged.
- [x] **HomeScreen wiring** — slot Start button passes `slotMode = "extraction"` through `UIController.openScreen("Lab", "extraction")` → `SynthesizeScreen.open(uiController, slotMode)`. `UIController.openScreen` updated to forward varargs.
- [x] **Server-driven load gate** — `PlayerReady` S2C Event added to Manifest. `VaultService.onProfileLoaded` fires it after `fireVaultUpdate`. `ClientInit` replaced `task.defer({ loaded = true })` with `RemoteController.connect("PlayerReady", ...)` so the loading screen holds until vault state is guaranteed on the client.
- [x] **Picker declarative rows** — replaced `Observer/rowsFrame` imperative pattern in `makeVaultBrowser` with `scope:Computed` → `[Children]`; eliminates race where Observer fired before `rowsFrame` was set, leaving picker permanently empty when vault was already populated at open time.
- [x] **Compound display names** — picker rows and slot bar now show `Compounds[id].name` (e.g. "Sodium Chloride ×1") instead of raw IDs; `HomeScreen` gets `Compounds` require; `or id` fallback for unknown IDs.
- [x] **Extraction confirm wired** — `HomeScreen` threads `slotIndex` through `openScreen("Lab", "extraction", slotIndex)`; `SynthesizeScreen.open` gains `slotIndex` param; extraction `onSelect` calls `SlotController.startExtraction` then navigates Home. Synthesis `onSelect` unchanged.
- [x] **Starter extraction unblocked** — `SlotStartExtraction` handler now allows starters (`compoundEntry.starter == true`) to bypass `formulaLog.discovered` check; non-starters still require discovery.
- [x] **SlotController.startExtraction arg fix** — server handler takes only `compoundId`; client was incorrectly passing `(slotIndex, compoundId)` → `slotIndex` landed as `compoundId` → `"invalid args"`. Fixed to pass only `compoundId`; `_slotIndex` kept in signature for future per-slot routing.
- [x] **SlotService state translation fix** — `fireSlotUpdate` and all direct `SlotStateUpdate:FireClient` calls were sending raw `SlotMachine.SlotRecord` objects (no `state` field). Client `HomeScreen` checks `slot.state` → always `nil` → showed `"—"`. Added `toClientSlot(raw)` translator: `workRemaining > 0` → `"RUNNING"`, `== 0` → `"DONE"`, else `"EMPTY"`. Applied to all 3 call sites (tick loop, `fireSlotUpdate`, `applySkipToSlot`). 457/457 tests green.

## In progress

Phase 13 Studio debug pass complete. B1–B6 all resolved. B4 (chambers 7–10) is a Studio place-file change — save the place in Studio to persist it.

## Phase 12D — Lab world build (done in Studio)

Full lab + exterior built as clone-safe BaseParts. Lives at **`workspace.Plots.PLOT_TEMPLATE`** (so `PlotService` finds it) — see `docs/PLOT_TEMPLATE.md` for the full layout. Code↔map contract verified end-to-end: `PlotService` template lookup, `SlotController.getChamberPart` path (`Plots.<userId>.Lab.Chambers.<i>`), and `RevealController` per-chamber SpotLight/PointLight/ParticleEmitter + `WingLight` resolution all resolve. `Burst` emitters configured for the reveal pop.

## Next

- ~~**B4 — Slots 7–10**~~ — fixed in Phase 13: chambers 7–10 added to PLOT_TEMPLATE (must be saved in Studio to persist; `.rbxl` is gitignored).
- **WingLight dim is invisible:** `WingLight` is a Folder-child PointLight (no transform → no light), so the reveal dim has no visible effect. To make it visible: `RevealController` searches recursively + WingLights live on parts. Map currently matches the existing contract.
- ~~**B5 — RevealPrompt inert**~~ — fixed in Phase 13: `SlotController.bindRevealPrompts` wires `Triggered → reveal(i)`, enabled only on DONE slots.
- ~~**Plot overlap (PlotService)**~~ — fixed in Phase 13 (B3): clones now grid-offset via `PivotTo`, players routed to own plot.

## Known issues

- ~~**RevealCard patent timing (12D fix)**~~ — fixed in Phase 13 (B2): `SlotReveal` returns authoritative `isPatent`; `RevealController` reads it instead of polling `StateController.patents`.

## Phase 12C completed (2026-06-15)

- [x] Task 23: PRECIPICE_PHASE12C -- SynthesizeScreen nil vault guard; UIController 0.8s min loading screen; PlotService (PLOT_TEMPLATE clone per player, Plots folder); RevealController (§13 queue + VFX: dim WingLights → spotlight → 3× pulse → particle burst → chamber fade); RevealCard overlay (Keep/Sell + patent WORLD FIRST banner); SlotController.reveal delegates to RevealController; HomeScreen revealQueue HUD counter; ClientInit wires RevealController; 457/457 tests green
- [x] Task 24: PRECIPICE_PHASE12C_FIXES -- vault schema root fix (VaultService sends `data.vault.compounds` not `data.vault`; SynthesizeScreen sort crash resolved; VaultController.getQuantity correct); LoadingScreen fade (TweenService 0.3s bg fade before scope cleanup; duplicate UIController Changed connection removed); HUD overlay (SlotPanel height 200px anchored bottom; "Hide"/"Show Slots" toggle); ✕ close button added to SynthesizeScreen, MarketScreen, FormulaLogScreen, LeaderboardScreen, SyndicateScreen, SettingsScreen; 457/457 tests green
